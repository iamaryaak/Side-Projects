# Side-Projects

## Technologies and Libraries Used
  
   * Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Tweepy, Open-CV, PIL, Matplotlib
   
## IDEs Used
  
   * PyCharm, Vim (Terminal), VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
   
## Project 1 - File Management
  
  * __Description:__ Organized files on my local drive by using the operating system dependent functionalities to seperate files by file type (file extensions).
  * __Modules/Libraries Used:__ os, shutil
  * __Possible Next Steps:__ I would like the process to be automated in a way such that, whenever I download a file off google, the Downloads folder will be automatically organized.

## Project 2 - Digit Recognization

  * __Description:__ Using the MNIST dataset, I need to correctly identify the handwritten digits automatically. I followed a Youtube tutorial to understand the basics of keras and tensorflow. 
  * __Modules/Libraries Used:__ tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib, jupyter notebook
  * __Possible Next Steps:__ I would like to do this with letter recognition, same principles but different data set and implement it on my own.
